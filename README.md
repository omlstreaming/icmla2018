# icmla2018
This repository contains the source code for the icmla2018 paper,
where we compared different streaming technologies for low latency and high-throughput 
online machine learning execution.

The code is available for review only, and it is not expected to run the benchmarks without completing the necessary configuration steps. 
However, we believe it should be sufficient to have a glimpse of the processes executed and therfore interpret the performance results presented in the paper.
